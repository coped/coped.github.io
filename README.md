# Etch-A-Sketch
This is a JavaScript based etch-a-sketch program. To use, open the .html file in an internet browser.

With CSS grid, a grid of squares (divs) is created and organized within the grid container, and they individually change to a random color upon interaction with the mouse pointer.

You can also re-create the grid with your own size parameters.

This is a small project created to test the author in JS DOM manipulation.
