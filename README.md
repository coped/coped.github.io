# Etch-A-Sketch
JS based sketchpad/ etch-a-sketch hybrid. To use, open the .html file in an internet browser.

With CSS grid, a square grid of divs is created within a container, and their individual attributes change upon interaction with the mouse pointer.

You can also re-create the square grid with your own size parameters.

This is a small project created to test the author in JS DOM manipulation.
